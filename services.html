            <h1>Our Services</h1>
            <p class="justified">Our objective is to love and serve the poorest of
                the poor, both materially and spiritually, not
                only in the slums, but also all over the world
                wherever they may be. In loving and serving the
                poorest of the poor, we endeavor to live the
                love of God in prayer and action in a life
                marked by the simplicity and humility of the
                Gospel. We “put our love into action” by:
                • nursing the sick and dying destitutes;
                • gathering and teaching the poor and little
                street children;
                • visiting and caring for beggars, leprosy
                patients and their children;
                • giving shelter to the abandoned and homeless;
                • caring for the unwanted, the unloved and the lonely.
                In her effort to “bring souls to God and God to
                the souls”, Mother Teresa taught us: “What
                these poor people need desperately is genuine
                kindness – But what we want to bring into their
                lives is not merely kindness and benevolence!
                Our spirit is the spirit of Christ, Whom we see
                and serve in the poor, the suffering and the
                sick. Hence mere material help, even the most
                abundant, could never change these lives for
                the better. However if supplemented and
                inspired by spiritual outlook and guidance,
                surely some bright rays of hope and courage will
                penetrate into their sad lives, and do away, to
                some extent with that
                terrible destitution that drives so many to lawlessness, vice and
                despair.”
                The mission of our active Sisters is supported by
                the prayer, silence, fasting and penance of our
                contemplative Sisters.</p>
